		Sometimes it's hard to know what part of the interface has your <em>focus</em>; if you start typing, which window, field, or menu will receive your keystrokes? Finally, put an end to such focal ambiguity! Or maybe you know where your focus is, but you just want to concentrate on one window at a time. No problem; this plug-in highlights the focal element or window, and dims everything else on the screen.

            The top of the OmniDazzle window has a 3-D view of the available effect plug-ins. Each card has a live preview using the effect's current settings. In the center is the currently selected plug-in. To select a different effect, just click one of the other cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some plug-ins may not appear, based on the capabilities of your graphics hardware. We've tried to accomodate a wide range of configurations, but some plug-ins require features not available on all hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each plug-in has its own info, commands, and settings. Click the <span class="UI">Info</span> tab to see a <a href="info.html">description of the effect and a list of its commands</a>. Click the <span class="UI">Configuration</span> tab to change the <a href="commands.html">commands for activating the effect</a>, or to adjust the <a href="settings.html">settings for how the effect looks</a>.
